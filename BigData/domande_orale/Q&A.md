- logica di hive (Apache Hive)

Apache Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-like query language for big data stored in the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides an SQL-like interface for querying and managing large datasets stored in Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) and other storage systems such as Apache HBase, Apache Kudu, and Amazon S3.

Hive allows you to write SQL-like queries, called HiveQL, that are translated into a series of MapReduce jobs that are executed on a Hadoop cluster. The results of these jobs can then be accessed through Hive's SQL-like interface or through other data processing tools such as Apache Pig and Apache Spark.

Hive is useful for tasks such as data summarization, ad-hoc querying, and analysis of large datasets. It can also be used to perform ETL (extract, transform, load) operations, allowing you to ingest data from a variety of sources into a central repository for analysis and reporting.

Hive is often used in conjunction with other tools in the Hadoop ecosystem, such as Pig, Spark, and HBase, to build data processing pipelines and workflows.
